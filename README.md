Performs simulations to calculate the probability of success in Ph3 based on reaching between 0.8 - 1.25 times the target efficacy, based on the model-based dose-response using the MCP-Mod framework. Extends the existing package for continuous endpoints to binary case. Continuous case is previously described by  Liu et al https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pst.2330.
